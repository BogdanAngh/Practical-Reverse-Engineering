# Practical-Reverse-Engineering
Here I'll keep the solutions to the exercises from the book "Practical Reverse Engineering", by Bruce Dang, Alexandre Gazet, and Elias Bachaalany.
I am working on a Windows 7 x64 machine, so there will be times when I won't find a solution to some of the disassembled functions.
I am using WinDbg.
